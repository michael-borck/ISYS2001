## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-borck/ISYS2001.git
cd ISYS2001
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

Begin with Module 01 to establish Python programming fundamentals:

1. Start with `01_Hello_Python!_Your_First_Steps_in_Coding.ipynb` for basic syntax
2. Progress through `02_Fixing_Mistakes_in_Python.ipynb` to learn debugging
3. Review `03_Making_Your_Python_Code_Clear_and_Readable.ipynb` for best practices
4. Complete the mini-project to apply learned concepts

### Module Progression

Each module builds upon previous knowledge:
- **Modules 01-02**: Python basics and user interaction
- **Modules 03-04**: Control structures and loops
- **Modules 05-06**: Functions and data organization
- **Module 07**: Data analysis with pandas

### Running Notebooks

Open any notebook file (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter and execute cells sequentially:

```python
# Example from Module 01
print("Hello, Data Science World!")
```

### Mini-Projects

Each module includes practical mini-projects:
- **AI Budget Tracker**: Apply Python basics to financial tracking
- **Finance Tracker Profile Setup**: User input and data validation
- Additional projects in subsequent modules
